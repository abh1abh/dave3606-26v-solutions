condition(x) would run on every element, which gives gives complexity of: n * c(n).
key_transform(n) and value_transform(n) will only run on those elements that satisfy condition(x). Let's say that this is m elements. This gives key_transform(x) and value_transform(x) the complexity of: m * k(n) and m * v(n).

Total time complexity: n * c(n) + m * k(n) + m * v(n) = n * c(n) + m * (k(n) + v(n))
Since m <= n, we can use a split asymptotic notation: Θ(n * c(n)) + O(n * (k(n) + v(n)))
