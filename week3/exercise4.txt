Exercise 4a:
result = [transform(x) for x in values if expensive_condition(x)]

Here expensive_condition(x) would be run n times giving it a complexity of:
n * Θ(n) = Θ(n^2)
While m is the number of elements satisfied by expensive_condition(x) giving it an complexity of:
m * Θ(1) = Θ(m)
The total complexity is then:
Θ(n^2) + Θ(m) = Θ(n^2)


Exercise 4b:
filtered = [x for x in values if expensive_condition(x)]
result = [transform(x) for x in filtered]

Here the filtering would n times which gives it a complexity of:
n * Θ(n) = Θ(n^2)

The result would iterate through m elements in filtered which gives an complexity of:
m * Θ(1) = Θ(m)

The total complexity is:
Θ(n^2) + Θ(m) = Θ(n^2)

Exercise 4c:
The refactoring preserves the asymptotic complexity. Both have an overall complexity of Θ(n^2).
Both still do the expensive condition check which is performed n times. This keeps
the overall complexity at Θ(n^2).
