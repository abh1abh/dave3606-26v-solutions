Exercise 4a:

Here, expensive_condition(x) would be run n times, giving it a complexity of:
n * Θ(n) = Θ(n^2)
If m is the number of elements satisfied by the condition, then the complexity of the calls to transform(x) is:
m * Θ(1) = Θ(m)
The total complexity is then:
Θ(n^2) + Θ(m) = Θ(n^2) (since m <= n <= n^2)


Exercise 4b:
Here too, the filtering is run on each of the n elements, which gives it a complexity of:
n * Θ(n) = Θ(n^2)

The second line iterates through m elements in `filtered`, which gives a complexity of:
m * Θ(1) = Θ(m)

The total complexity is:
Θ(n^2) + Θ(m) = Θ(n^2)

Exercise 4c:
The refactoring preserves the asymptotic complexity. Both have an overall complexity of Θ(n^2).
Both still perform the expensive condition check n times; version 2 does not save
any work by avoiding transforming elements that do not pass the filter, since the comprehension
in version 1 does that already.
