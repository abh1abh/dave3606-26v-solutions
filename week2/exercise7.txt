In 9n^2 + 5n + 42, the highest-order term is n^2.

Below, the comparison operators are used in the "loose" sense of showing which side has got the highest-order term.

O means an upper bound, so the ones with the same or a greater highest-order term are true, but only the one with the same highest-order term is tight:
O(n^2) -> n^2 ≤ n^2
Incorrect:
O(n^3) -> n^2 ≤ n^3 (true, but not tight)
O(n) -> n^2 ≤ n (false)

Θ means both an upper and a lower bound, so only the one with the same highest-order term is correct, and Θ is always tight:
Θ(n^2) -> n^2 = n^2
Incorrect:
Θ(n^3) -> n^2 ≠ n^3 (false)
Θ(n) -> n^2 ≠ n (false)

Ω means a lower bound, so the ones with the same or a smaller highest-order term are true, but only the one with the same highest-order term is tight:
Ω(n^2) -> n^2 ≥ n^2
Incorrect:
Ω(n^3) -> n^2 ≥ n^3 (false)
Ω(n) -> n^2 ≥ n (true, but not tight)
