In 6 n lg n + 2n + 1000, the highest-order term is n lg n.

Below, the comparison operators are used in the "loose" sense of showing which side has got the highest-order term.

O means an upper bound, so the ones with the same or a greater highest-order term are correct:
O(n^2) -> n lg n ≤ n^2
O(n lg n) -> n lg n ≤ n lg n
Incorrect:
O(n) -> n lg n ≤ n (false - the logarithm does contribute with growth even though it is very slow)

Θ means both an upper and a lower bound, so only the one with the same highest-order term is correct:
Θ(n lg n) -> n lg n = n lg n
Incorrect:
Θ(n^2) -> n lg n = n^2 (false)
Θ(n) -> n lg n = n (false)

Ω means a lower bound, so the ones with the same or a smaller highest-order term are correct:
Ω(n lg n) -> n lg n ≥ n lg n
Ω(n) -> n lg n ≥ n
Incorrect:
Ω(n^2) -> n lg n ≥ n^2 (false)
