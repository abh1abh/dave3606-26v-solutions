Best case: 5n
Worst case 2n^2 + 7n +1


a.

Correct:
O(n^2) -> general case ≤ n^2
Ω(n) -> general case ≥ n

Incorrect:
O(n) -> general case ≤ n (false due to worst case being n^2)
Θ(n^2) -> general case = n^2 (too high to cover all cases — best case is only linear)
Θ(n) ->general case = n (too low to cover all cases — worst case is quadratic)
Ω(n^2) -> general case ≥ n^2 (false — best case is linear)


b.

O(n^2) correctly describes the algorithm's upper bound, but it does not say anything about how
fast the algorithm can be in the best case or how it performs on average.
A complete description would be:
Best case: Θ(n) (using Θ instead of Ω here shows that the best case is exactly this, rather than "not better than this, but maybe worse")
Worst case: Θ(n^2) (using Θ instead of O here shows that the worst case is exactly this, rather than "not worse than this, but maybe better")
General case: Ω(n) and O(n^2)


c.

The algorithm's best case is 5n = Θ(n), so it is possible for the algorithm to run faster, so the statement is false.
