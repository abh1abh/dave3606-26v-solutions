Best case: 5n
Worst case 2n^2 + 7n +1

O(n^2) -> general case ≤ n^2 
O(n) -> general case ≤ n (false due to worst case being n^2)

Θ(n^2) -> general case = n^2 (too strict — best case is only linear)
Θ(n) ->general case = n (too small — worst case is quadratic)

Ω(n^2) -> general case ≥ n^2 (false — best case is linear)
Ω(n) -> general case ≥ n 


Why O(n^2) is correct but incomplete description:
O(n^2) only describe the algorithm's upper bound. It does not say anything about how 
fast the algorithm can be in the best case or how it performs on average. 
A complete description would be:
Best case: Θ(n)
Worst case: O(n^2)
General case: Θ(n) and O(n^2)

Is the statement true?
No. The algorithm's best case is 5n, so the statement is not true.
