Line 17: In Java, strings are immutable, so every += operation needs to allocate a
         new string, copy the old content and add the new content. The first time,
         this takes k steps, the second time takes 2k, the third time takes 3k, and so on,
         and the last time takes nk, for a total of k * n * (n + 1) / 2.
Line 19: nk + 1 since we need to loop through the string and then add the last content.
Line 20: 1

Line 17 results in `buildHtmlList` being Θ(kn^2).
