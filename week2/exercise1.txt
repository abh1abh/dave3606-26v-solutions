The algorithm is not linear-time because the merge sort still has to perform Θ(n lg n) computational work,
and artificially sleeping does not reduce an algorithm’s asymptotic complexity.
Asymptotic notation ignores constant factors, so even 1000000n is equivalent to n, which is a lower-order term than n lg n.
If this algorithm is given enough input, we will eventually see that the merge sort
starts taking more time than 1000000n seconds, and then the sleep can't rewind time.
