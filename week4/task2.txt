add() stack starts at 90
(hex) 90-93 94-97 98-9b
        45    3     42
      result  x      y

Note: the solution that was originally published had incorrect memory addresses for x and y in `main`
(they were the same as in `add`). This was corrected on February 2. Within a stack frame, however,
the placement of the variables and parameters is up to the compiler, so the relative order within
a stack frame could vary (but parameters and local variables are commonly placed in opposite orders).

main() stack starts at a0
(hex) a0-a3 a4-a7 a8-ab
       ?      42    3
      result   y    x
