int value = 0x12345678;
unsigned char* bytes = (unsigned char*) &value;

a)
0x40: 0x78
0x41: 0x56
0x42: 0x34
0x43: 0x12

c)
On a big-endian machine, the bytes are stored in the opposite order.
Where the most significant byte is stored at the left
0x40: 0x12
0x41: 0x34
0x42: 0x56
0x43: 0x78

d)
Casting &value to unsigned char* treats the address as a pointer to 1-byte elements.
This lets you access individual bytes of the 4-byte int directly (byte-wise), and using
unsigned char avoids sign-extension and interpretation issues when reading raw bytes.
