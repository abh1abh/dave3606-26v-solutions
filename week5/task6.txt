In C, a matrix can be represented as an array of pointers to rows: int** matrix;

a. Explain how such a matrix is typically allocated in memory.

The matrix is allocated in two steps:
1. First, an array of row pointers is allocated contiguously in memory
2. Then, each row is allocated separately in different memory locations

This creates a two-level structure where the pointers themselves are stored consecutively,
but the actual row data is scattered throughout the heap. 
Each pointer in the array points to a different, random memory location where its 
corresponding row is stored.

b. Compared to a single contiguous array, what are the advantages and disadvantages of this
representation with respect to:
i. Memory allocation
Advantages:
- Can allocate rows of different sizes 
- Can resize individual rows independently
- Failed allocation of one row doesn't lose all data

Disadvantages:
- Extra memory for storing pointers
- More complex deallocation logic

ii. Cache friendliness
Advantages:
- None

Disadvantages:
- Poor cache locality. Rows scattered in memory cause cache misses
- Cannot use CPU cache. 
- Contiguous array keeps rows together, improving cache hits


iii. Flexibility
Advantages:
- Can have rows of different lengths 
- Easy to swap entire rows
- Can share rows between matrices
     

Disadvantages:
- More complex pointer management
- Potential for memory leaks
